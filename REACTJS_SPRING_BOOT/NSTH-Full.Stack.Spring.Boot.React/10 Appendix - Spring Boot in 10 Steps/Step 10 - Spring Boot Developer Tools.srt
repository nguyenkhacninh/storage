<font color="#cfcfcf">In 2 seconds</font>

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
<font color="#fcfcfc">Stop the application</font>

<font color="#bdbdbd">Hello</font>

63
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
<font color="#fcfcfc">If I just make a change directly here</font>

64
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
<font color="#d2d2d2">What I do that</font>

65
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
<font color="#fcfcfc">Turn this off</font>

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
<font color="#fcfcfc">Also</font>

67
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
<font color="#e9e9e9">Just look at how much time it takes</font>

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
<font color="#e9e9e9">Turn off how much time did it take</font>

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
<font color="#cacaca">You can see that this actually takes to win the second</font>

<font color="#eaeaea">Pretty cool isn't it so</font>

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968

74
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
<font color="#fcfcfc">Will not change at all</font>

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
<font color="#e5e5e5">So you cannot load things which are dependent on these</font>

76
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
<font color="#dcdcdc">It would only load those beans which of the which of the application beans again that's why I take slessor</font>

77
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
<font color="#ededed">Time when you make a change</font>

00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
<font color="#fcfcfc">When you make a change in the application</font>

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,992
<font color="#ededed">Only that specific things which are applications related</font>

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,088
<font color="#f2f2f2">RV loaded again and that's the reason why you see that it only takes</font>

00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
<font color="#f8f8f8">2 seconds</font>

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
<font color="#eaeaea">And imagine the amount of productivity you gain weight</font>

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536

88
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,288
<font color="#f4f4f4">That's a big productivity booster if you're using a spring boot application and if you're not using</font>

<font color="#e6e6e6">Dinglederper tools</font>

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
<font color="#fafafa">Then go ahead and try it</font>

00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
<font color="#cccccc">Industry</font>

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,088
