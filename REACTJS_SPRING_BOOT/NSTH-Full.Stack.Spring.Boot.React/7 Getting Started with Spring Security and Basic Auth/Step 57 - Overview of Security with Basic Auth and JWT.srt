00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
<font color="#dfdfdf">Securing</font>

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
<font color="#e2e2e2">The application that we have.</font>

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
<font color="#d7d7d7">What do we mean by security</font>

00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
<font color="#d7d7d7">Things you would have answered</font>

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,408
<font color="#dddddd">When we execute any request</font>

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,272
<font color="#efefef">We are not really needed to passing any user ID and password</font>

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
<font color="#e9e9e9">Which we are executing Auntie love</font>

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,208
<font color="#fafafa">Executed without user ID and password I can just go in</font>

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
<font color="#f2f2f2">And type in a URL</font>

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,352
<font color="#f0f0f0">And get the details of the to do or I can go in type in the URL</font>

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#d7d7d7">Aldi to do speech app</font>

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
<font color="#cecece">Present in here</font>

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
<font color="#fcfcfc">And that's what we mean by unsecured</font>

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
<font color="#d6d6d6">Applications</font>

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
<font color="#e4e4e4">You don't really need to</font>

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,664
<font color="#dcdcdc">To be able to access this service so if somebody knows</font>

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
<font color="#e9e9e9">Do you like it</font>

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,808
<font color="#eaeaea">Then that's sufficient for them they'll be able to break into the application and use the information which is present in</font>

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
<font color="#fcfcfc">And that's not good</font>

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
<font color="#f2f2f2">So in the next few steps</font>

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
<font color="#f7f7f7">We would start our journey</font>

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,512
<font color="#f3f3f3">Towards securing the entire application</font>

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,864
<font color="#f3f3f3">Woodstock with using a basic approach called basic Authentication</font>

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
<font color="#d8d8d8">Along with</font>

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
<font color="#eeeeee">Every request</font>

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
<font color="#f1f1f1">Do you need to send a user ID and password</font>

30
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
<font color="#f9f9f9">So if I have to agree with this request</font>

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
<font color="#e7e7e7">Tell me to send another user ID and password</font>

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="#cbcbcb">Music of the fact that sending a user ID and password with every request</font>

33
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
<font color="#dbdbdb">It's not safe because it's a mitigating user ID and password</font>

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
<font color="#fcfcfc">Then they can do anything with it</font>

35
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,184
<font color="#fbfbfb">And that's where we create a temporary token called</font>

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
<font color="#fcfcfc">JWT</font>

37
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
<font color="#f1f1f1">Jason</font>

38
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#cdcdcd">Dokkan</font>

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
<font color="#e3e3e3">We discussed about what is the difference between basic security in JWT</font>

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
<font color="#e9e9e9">And how DWTS more secure</font>

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
<font color="#ececec">Enhance</font>

42
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#f2f2f2">With Authentication</font>

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
<font color="#d6d6d6">And have a front-end application connect to it</font>

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
<font color="#d1d1d1">There a wide variety of things that you need to do</font>

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
<font color="#f4f4f4">Get set for all of them</font>

46
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
<font color="#fcfcfc">And I see you in the next step</font>
