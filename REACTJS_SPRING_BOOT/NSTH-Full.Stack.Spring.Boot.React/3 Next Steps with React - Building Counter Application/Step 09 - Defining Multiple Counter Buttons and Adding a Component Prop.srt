00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,352
<font color="#b8b8b8">The previous steps</font>

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:11,008
<font color="#adadad">We started designing a counter when we did a plus one variable increment the counter</font>

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
<font color="#ededed">If you need to have multiple counters</font>

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
<font color="#fcfcfc">With different values on them</font>

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
<font color="#a6a6a6">Let's take</font>

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
<font color="#c7c7c7">Indus Pacific step</font>

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
<font color="#d0d0d0">We have a single counter on Tinder</font>

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
<font color="#ededed">It's going adding another account</font>

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
<font color="#bfbfbf">Just I did encounter in here</font>

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
<font color="#f6f6f6">What would happen now</font>

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:36,608
<font color="#e0e0e0">I go to my location to see that there are two different counters with their own individual states</font>

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
<font color="#f1f1f1">If I add one more counter</font>

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
<font color="#a5a5a5">Is</font>

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,544
<font color="#ededed">All these three have their own individual counter States</font>

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
<font color="#efefef">That's cool right to know if you have</font>

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,432
<font color="#e8e8e8">The ability to create energy components and</font>

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
<font color="#e5e5e5">Include them in updating component</font>

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color="#dedede">But what do you want to be able to do</font>

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
<font color="#f8f8f8">Is</font>

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
<font color="#f4f4f4">Number one</font>

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
<font color="#e1e1e1">Who want to be able to Define</font>

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,000
<font color="#f1f1f1">A different increment value for each of these</font>

24
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,632
<font color="#e8e8e8">The best one I want to have classified as being human this one I would want have less than as the inclement this one</font>

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
<font color="#bababa">Probably + 1 as the increment</font>

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
<font color="#fcfcfc">How can I do that</font>

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color="#eaeaea">That's number one</font>

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
<font color="#f2f2f2">Is venom</font>

29
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,944
<font color="#e5e5e5">Take this long to update the same variable right now we have three different things</font>

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
<font color="#979797">That's</font>

31
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
<font color="#e0e0e0">Problem statement number two</font>

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,624
<font color="#eeeeee">Let's start with problem statement number one in the specific step</font>

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
<font color="#f3f3f3">Do you want to be able to have different increment values for each of these buttons</font>

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
<font color="#fafafa">What are the important things that you need to understand is the increment value is not going to change to once</font>

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
<font color="#dbdbdb">I created button and I say this is increment value S5</font>

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#eeeeee">You cannot change to something else</font>

37
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,432
<font color="#f3f3f3">During the lifetime of that specific component</font>

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
<font color="#fcfcfc">And that's weird</font>

39
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,784
<font color="#dddddd">Property scams in order called</font>

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
<font color="#f4f4f4">What you can do is stupid counter</font>

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
<font color="#e0e0e0">You can add a property so how do I add a property</font>

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
<font color="#dddddd">But you can do that is by saying counter</font>

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
<font color="#dcdcdc">And say increment by</font>

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
<font color="#fcfcfc">Is equal to</font>

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
<font color="#b9b9b9">1</font>

46
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,312
<font color="#f4f4f4">Something increment by is equal to one there's a small mistake in here don't worry about it we'll fix it a little later</font>

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
<font color="#9d9d9d">I don't think you mean by fight</font>

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
<font color="#e1e1e1">Increment by</font>

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
<font color="#d9d9d9">I can go to the counter component</font>

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,624
<font color="#e9e9e9">And I can use the increment by</font>

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
<font color="#f8f8f8">Value how can I use that</font>

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
<font color="#f6f6f6">How does it come in</font>

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
<font color="#b9b9b9">Let's hear the way you can use the props</font>

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
<font color="#f9f9f9">It's a JavaScript value</font>

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
<font color="#dedede">And you can do that this this</font>

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
<font color="#9b9b9b">Got trucks</font>

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
<font color="#979797">Let's fix that</font>

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
<font color="#e8e8e8">Stop the step in here and try implementing that</font>

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
<font color="#e0e0e0">As an exercise near me</font>
